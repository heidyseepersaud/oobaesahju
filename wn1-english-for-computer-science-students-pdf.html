Hello prospective CS applicants, I remember being in your place a year ago. I was rejected from CS co-op, with a 95.5 average and a good AIF. But, with some persistence, creativity, and hard work, I successfully managed to transfer into CS Co-op here at UW.

I hope this serves to lessen some of the anxiety that comes with university admissions. # Backgroun. Интерактивная доска (англ.
